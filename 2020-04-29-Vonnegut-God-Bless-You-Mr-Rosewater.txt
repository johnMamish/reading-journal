Finally, a Kurt Vonnegut book I wasn't head over heels in love with. Still a good book though.

This book is confusing and surreal, but still firmly rooted in concrete descriptions of real things that could actually happen. The things that are happening though are so strangely juxtapositioned that it almost defies reality. And of course, in good Vonnegut fashion, they are all told in a nonlinear way. I'm going to take my best stab at summarizing the book though.

The Rosewater family is old and vast money, about 100 years old when the events of the book take place in the mid-60s. After skipping out on serving the Union in the Civil War, the family's patriarch accumulates capital by overcharging the U.S. for bayonets made in a converted saw factory and marrying a "rich and ugly woman". He compounds on his wealth by relentlessly vertically integrating his decidedly po-dunk businesses of hog farming and saw manufacturing. He builds a huge mansion in Rosewater, Illinois. After his wealth balloons to enormous proportions, a trust fund is set up to ensure that his distant descendants are taken care of with the fortune's dividends. Unless declared legally insane, the fortune will be passed down through generations of the Rosewater family.

His great-grandson, Eliot Rosewater, is one of those descendants. Serving valiantly in WWII but suffering a severe nervous breakdown after mistaking 3 german volunteer firefighters (2 old men and a 14-year old boy) for soliders and killing them, Eliot meets his wife-to-be in a hospital in Europe (as many American GIs did). Once back home, the heir worth nearly $100 million (in 1950s money) finds himself viscously alcoholic and obsessed with becoming a volunteer firefighter (for some strange reason). He regularly deserts his wife and hobos from town to town, getting drunk, screaming to whoever's around him about how stupid it is that he was born with money, and then dashing off checks worth hundreds (of 1950s money (thousands today)) to random passerby. His personal convictions are strongly shaped by a widely unrecognized science fiction author named Kilgore Trout.

Inspired by a Kilgore Trout novel, Eliot conspires to become a sort of ultimate philanthropist giving of his attention, love, and money to the "undesirables" that live in his family's traditionally recognized home of Rosewater (although for generations their family hasn't lived there except for a couple days a year).

  -- God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, Chapter 3

Eliot and his wife Sylvia move into Rosewater and Eliot dives into his work of being an unthinking wellspring of money and empathy, doling out money to anyone who needs it and listening with abundant patience to the complaints and troubles of Rosewater's most hopeless citizens. He also indulges his desire to play volunteer fireman and becomes a Fire Lieutenant. Sylvia suffers an emotional breakdown because of the amount of suffering she deals with when helping Rosewater's citizens; after spending time in a mental hospital, she goes to Paris where she lives it up and does her best to forget about Rosewater and Eliot.

A young lawyer from the law firm that manages the Rosewater fortune, Norman Mushari, sees that Eliots actions could be construed as insane and he could be parted from the family fortune, with it landing in the hands of a very distant cousin in Rhode Island who is an insurance agent. The cousin rubs shoulders with rich families in Rhode Island but is quite poor himself; his relationship with his wife is dead and he feels pressured to become richer but never seems to manage to do it. Mushari plans to acquire quite a bit of the money by representing Eliot's distant family in the court proceedings.

Living in squalor and alcoholism now, Eliot is as posessed as ever by his job, waking up at all hours of the night to hear about the problems of Rosewater's citizens. Eliot's father gets back in touch with him, hoping to get Eliot to abandon what he considers to be an idiotic crusade. After much pestering, Eliot is persuaded to meet with his estranged wife, a meeting that Eliot's father hopes will result in an heir to the Rosewater fortune, as Sylvia and Eliot's marriage has bore no children. Eliot suffers a nervous breakdown as he leaves Rosewater and ends up in an insane asylum, having lost a year of his memory. While he was at the asylum, he hired his favorite writer, Kilgore Trout, to help him devise an explaination for why his philanthropic actions weren't insane. The story ends as Eliot's consciousness snaps back into reality. His legal insanity fight having become tabloid fodder, nearly 60 women from Rosewater have illegitimately claimed to carried his children. Not wanting his greedy distant relatives and Mushari to get his money and not wanting to defend his insanity in court in a way that would cheapen his philanthropic efforts in Rosewater, Eliot simply acknowledges all of the mothers who claim to have had children with him, thereby diffusing the fortune among hundreds of struggling people in the town of Rosewater.

>"Well - " and Trout rubbed his hands, watched the rubbing, "what you did in Rosewater County was far from insane. It was quite possibly the most important social experiment of our time, for it dealt on a very small scale with a problem whose queasy horrors will eventually be made world-wide by the sophistocation of machines. The problem is this: How to love people who have no use?"
>"In time, almost all men and women will become worthless as producers of goods, food, services, and more machines, as sources of practical ideas in the areas of economics, engineering, and probably medicine, too. So - if we can't find reasons and methods for treasuring human beings because they are human beings, then we might as well, as so often been suggested, rub them out."

=======================================


This book raises nuanced and challenging social questions and deserves a good re-read, but I didn't relish it as much as I usually do KV's books. It wasn't the disjointedness, and it wasn't that it doesn't raise big, trippy issues. SH5 and Galapagos had a steady drip of "woah, dude" moements, and Bluebeard and Mother Night were propelled along by prose, characters, and mystery. Maybe this one comparatively felt like a trudge to me because the "woah, dude" moments are somber, societal questions and there isn't a big mystery. None of the characters are really charming, either (like Rabo Karabekian and the widow Berman are). There are rich assholes, the shell-shocked Sylvia, the depressed Fred Rosewater of Rhode Island, the conniving lawyers, and Eliot who's so good-natured that he seems entirely spineless.

I still crammed the book down my throat in a single 3-hour sitting, so it couldn't have been that bad.


>P.S. Who really does run this crazy country? These creeps [with all the money] sure don't.
