God do I fucking love Vonnegut. I don't know why. Maybe I do know why but damn is his writing easy to read and profound.

Sateen dura-luxe, people dead in the eyes when they start producing great art, a novelist who thinks modern art is bullshit. A widowed Italian countess who thinks modern art is the blankness man (men in particular, not women) needs after so many atrocities have been committed (WWII always looms in Vonnegut's mind).

"Thank you, Meat." Oh, happy Meat. Oh, happy Soul. Oh, happy Rabo Karabekian.
