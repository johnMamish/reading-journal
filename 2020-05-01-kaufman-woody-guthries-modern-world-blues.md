Guthrie was a sophisticated New Yorker who rubbed elbows with many bohemian avant-garde artists, dancers, and writers, all of which informed his work. He inhabited the same spaces that would play host to Warhol and VU 10 years later, and punk music 25 years later. He intentionally played a po-dunk hillbilly character to artistic effect, the same way that David Bowie played the facist Thin White Duke to artistic effect.

Headcanon: Guthrie was living in Greenwich village the same time as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. At the very least he heard their music streaming out of clubs or on radio stations. Maybe he even went in for a listen and saw Bird in the flesh.
