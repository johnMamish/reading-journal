Chapter 6: The power clean
================================================================
What is it? Why is it important?
--------------------------------
The power clean is important because - among the other exercises described in Strarting Strength - it is a black sheep: whereas any of the other exercises rely only on the trainee's ability to apply force to the bar, to do a clean the trainee must impart kinetic energy rapidly; she must exert power.

The clean itself is a very complicated exercise which is the first half of the "clean and jerk", a weightlifting movement that is a part of olympic competitions. To perform a clean, the bar begins on the ground, and the trainee "pulls" it up to her shoulders, dropping her body to catch the bar, and ending in a front squat position. After coming out of the bottom (essentially front squatting the weight), the clean has been completed. The clean has changed over time; earlier versions used a "split stance" at the bottom. Here, we concern ourselves with the "power clean", a simplified version of the clean with a more restricted range of motion.

Because of the mechanics of the clean, there is a phase of the exercise where the trainee cannot impart force to the bar. Once the bar passes the hips, there is greatly reduced ability to apply force to the bar, and once the trainee's feet briefly leave the floor, it is completely impossible to apply force. Therefore, the trainee has a very short time window in which she must impart a great deal of velocity into the bar. The power that the trainee has exerted during the first phase of the clean is conserved in the bar's kinetic energy and therefore velocity. The only way to get a heavy bar moving fast enough to catch on her shoulders is to exert a great deal of power.

Power is critical in the athletic community. Athletes with more "power" can accelerate their own body, an opponents body, or a thrown implement more readily; the NFL uses the "vertical jump" - a direct measure of power output capability - as an indicator of athleticism; and as discussed above, olympic weightlifters must output a great deal of power as a direct part of their sport.

"powerlifiting" exercises (squat, deadlift, press) and explosive "weightlifting" exercises (clean, power clean, snatch) have a symbiotic relationship. Whereas the (poorly-named) powerlifting exercise contribute to the maximum force a trainee can exert, weightlifting exercises help the trainee rapidly apply the maximum force they can. The increased maximum force from powerlifting will improve power output during weightlifiting exercises, and weightlifiting will improve the rate at which the nervous system can recruit muscle fibers, a boon to powerlifting exercises.

Learning the power clean
--------------------------------
Rippetoe says that the power clean has 3 critical, basic positions:
  - The rack position
    This is the ending position for the exercise. In this position, the barbell rests on the front deltoid muscles (It is nestled between the neck and the shoulders). The bar should rest gently in the hands, with the elbows pointing straight foward and the triceps as close to parallel with the ground as possible. The hands and arms should not support any weight, but they may serve the role of "trapping" the bar in the shoulders.
    For some trainees with loger forearms than upper arms, it may be necessary to widen the grip from the standard which is one hand-width outside deadlift grip.
  - The hang position
    This is the penultimate position. In this position, the bar hangs from the arms and is at about mid-hip. the elbows should be fully extended.
  - The jumping position
    In this position, the hips and knees are unlocked. The butt is sticking out and the bar is halfway up the thigh. As in the hang position, the elbows should be completely locked.
During the course of the exercise, the trainee pulls the bar off the floor to the jumping position, passes through the hang position, and ends in the rack position.

Rippetoe says that the entire movement should be taught in reverse order.
