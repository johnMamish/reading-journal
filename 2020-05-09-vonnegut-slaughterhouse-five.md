What is there to say about a book like this? What CAN I say about a book like this?

This is maybe my favorite book. This is one of the greatest achievements of American literature. I've read it before, but just finished it again now.

This is the one where the nature of how we experience reality is inspected, as processed by the mind of a world war II veteran whose perception of time has been severely warped by PTSD and brain injury. Or maybe he was abducted by aliens?

> It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds.

> He came slightly unstuck in time, saw the late movie backwards, then forwards again. It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:

> American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses, took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen.

> ... When the [American] bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped backe to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minearals... The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.
