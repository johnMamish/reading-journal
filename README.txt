I read a lot, but I don't feel like I retain a lot of what I read.

This repo contains summaries and analyses of books that I read.

We will see how far I go with this...


Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.

The works herein are my own summaries of works I have read. I avoid quoting from these works. If you feel as though your copyright has been infringed, please contact me at john dot mamish at-sign gmail and we can reach an amenable resolution.


Files are named in this way
    <date finished>-<book-author>-<book-title>.txt

if I can't remember what date I finished the book on, the day (or month) is set to 00. Dates might not be totally accurate, that's fine.
