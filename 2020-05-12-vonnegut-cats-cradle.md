I have a hard time discerning a deeper philosophical meaning within this book. As far as I can tell, it's just an ode to nihilism and fatalism.

Well, maybe it's a tirade against atomic warfare and the use of science to advance destruction. There is an interesting contrast between the aloofness and immaturity of Felix Hoenikker and the grave destruction that his creations led to. Not to say that Fermi and Einstein were aloof and immature, but the connection between solutions to the schrodinger equation and the instant slaughter of 100,000 Japanese civilians has difficult to wrap one's mind around... How could one think that Fermi scratching away at a chalkboard filled with calculus would have such a dire outcome? How could one think that the fictitous Felix Hoenikker's obsession with unusually shaped cannonball stacks would lead to the barrenness of planet earth?

... and how do all those thoughts tie back to Newt Hoenikker's tirade about cat's cradle string patterns in chapter 74? Is it an analogy: a fidgety bit of string is to a living, breathing conscious organism as equations on a chalkboard are to atom bombs?

Not one of my favorite KV books, but it has his trademark weirdness. It's like no other KV book. I'll give it that.
