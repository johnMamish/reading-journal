Thought I'd be able to get into this book, but I had a hard time. I think the prose was aimed at too young of an audience for me. The prose looked delicious, but it didn't taste delicious. The story looked delicious, but it didn't taste delicious.

The ultimate moral is about the connectedness of people and whether we can really know someone. I think it could be worth my time to go over it again so I can meditate on this moral. The fact that the book is clearly aimed at someone a decade younger than me doesn't have to take away from the main message (or maybe it does. Maybe this is a message I learned with I was 14 and have carried with me).

The ultimate plot device of having a real paper town (Agloe) doesn't seem to mesh with the big thematic elements for me.... I don't see how it matches up.


This rotten tomatoes review I found about the movie adaptation sums up some of my cynicism about the book:
"Margo has no plan, no money, no skills, and no self-discipline. The movie glosses over this, and romanticizes it, but she's basically just a drifter, and honestly, yes, she could end up finding her dreams, but she's more than likely to end up dead shortly after the movie's end."
At the same time, it also makes me think about the connectedness and divine spark of humanity inside every single person, "drifter" or otherwise.
