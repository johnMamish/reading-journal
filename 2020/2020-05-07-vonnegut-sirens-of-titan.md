This novel captured me in the way that I'm used to Vonnegut capturing me. Madcap surrealism, mystically meaningful fatalistic determinism, and sci-fi seasoning so silly and outlandish that it can't be taken at face value, but only as philosophical table-settings.

This is among Vonnegut's best, and has many of the elements that would come to mark his later work. I can't help but feel like the sci-fi elements are a little "oddly seasoned" in some places... The sci-fi parts in SH5 are so outlandish that they can be safely taken to be surrealist, philosophical devices. I feel like the sci-fi elements take themselves a little too seriously and dorkishly in Sirens. The military base on Mars, the antenna-controlled soldiers, the "Universal Will to Be". But I shouldn't gripe too much. all that stuff is just place settings for the Vonnegutian philosophical gems stored within.

Like most of Vonnegut's books, this one is hard to sum up because of how surreal it is; it plays with the notion of time's linearity a bit in a narrative sense, but is mercifully linearizable. That's not gonna stop this summary from sucking major ass though.


Rich heir and trust-fund-boy Malachi Constant has never wanted for anything. At the start of Sirens, he is the richest American ever, his father having amassed a huge fortune by day trading using a preposterously silly stock-picking scheme with the help of a bible. He is asked to visit Winston Niles Rumfoord and his dog. Rumfoord (also rich, but I can't remember why), through a science-fantasy plot device, has been "scattered through space and time", and only materializes on Earth once every 59 days, for an hour; he spends most of the rest of his time on the moon Titan (although the reader doesn't learn that until the last chapter of the book). He and his earth-bound wife don't allow gawkers to see his materializations, but much to his wife's chagrin, he invites Malachi. Because he is scattered through space and time, he knows everything that will come to pass (it's all inevitable). He tells Malachi that he will come to have a child with Mrs. Rumfoord and will ultimately live on Saturn's moon, Titan. Appalled by this though, Malachi and Mrs. Rumfoord do everything they can to sabotage Rumfoord's prediction. Malachi parties very hard and accidentally squanders his whole 3 billion dollar fortune, whereupon the story goes into sci-fi overdrive when Malachi is conscripted as a high-ranking officer into a Martian army (manned by humans) whose strings are pulled by Rumfoord. Mrs. Rumfoord is also kidnapped by the Martian army forces. En route to Mars, Malachi hears tell that there's a woman on board the ship, and he brags about his irresistability as a lover. He "seduces" (read: rapes) and impregnates the woman in a darkened room, and is horrified to find out that she's actually Mrs. Beatrice Rumfoord. Upon landing on Mars, Malachi's memory is wiped and he becomes an unthinking drone of the Martian army, controlled by pain eminating from an antenna in his brain. The pain is so severe he has little option but to obey orders given by commanders.

For 8 years, Malachi operates as a mindless private on Mars, occasionally trying to glimpse reality. When he does, his memory is medically wiped. He makes friends with a man named Stony, but Stony is likewise a curious man who tries to glimpse reality, and is executed for it (the execution is ironically carried out by Malachi, whose memory has been wiped so he doesn't know he's killing his best friend). The Martian army launches a comically-badly equipped invasion of earth (the Martian army was raised by Rumfoord for this purpose, and he doomed it to fail from the start), and almost all of the ~100k Martians are killed. The ship that Malachi and his commander Boaz are on, however, is diverted to Mercury, destined to not take part in the invasion.

Malachi and Boaz's ship autonomously worms itself impossibly deep into Mercury's caves, trapping them there. Boaz dotes on the beautiful, mindless, and unconditionally loving native creatures of Mercury called Harmoniums. Feeding off of mechanical vibrations, Boaz feeds them music, of which there is a vast supply on their spaceship. Malachi tries to escape. In the meantime on Earth, Rumfoord's materializations combined with the slaughter of underequipped Martians has spurned a global religious movement on Earth which emphasises the brotherhood of all on Earth and the uncaring indifference of god. Rumfoord, knowing that Malachi will escape from Mercury 3 years after the doomed Martian invasion, prophesizes the arrival of a messenger to Earth. Malachi escapes the Mercurian caves (leaving Boaz behind, contended as a caretaker of the harmoniums), and arrives on Earth, satisfying the religious role he was prophesized by Rumfoord to play. As soon as he arrives, Rumfoord tells him he is destined to leave on a ship destined for Titan, a moon of Saturn. His son Chrono and Chrono's mother, Mrs. Beatrice Rumfoord, are to go with him. Unbeknownst to them, the good-luck charm that 11-year old Chrono carries with him - a piece of scrap metal he found while on a field trip to a Martian flamethrower factory during his childhood on mars - is a part needed to repair the spaceship of an alien robot stranded on the moon Titan. The trio fly to Titan (during the 18-month journey they become friendly with one another), and live out the rest of their lives there.

There they meet the alien named Salo whose ship was damaged and who needs a replacement part. Over his ~500,000 years living on Saturn's moon, he has become friends with Rumfoord and Kazak. He was stranded while on a mission to take a message from his home planet as far as he could, at least 18 million light-years, and was ordered to keep the message secret until he reached his final destination (which may have been unknown to him?). Rumfoord, feeling as though humanity has been taken advantage of and used as a factory just to make a tiny spaceship part, shuns Salo and says they never were friends... unless Salo will open his secret message and show it to him. Being a robot "[incapable of disobeying his programming]", Salo refuses at first refuses, then has a change of heart, but it's too late. Rumfoord is scattered elsewhere in time and space by the whims of the "chrono-synclastic infundibula". Grief-stricken and having failed his mission by opening the message, Salo kills himself by disassembling his body.

During the ~40 years that Beatrice, Malachi, and Chrono live for on Titan, Malachi tries to reassamble Salo. He suceeds. After Chrono runs away to live among wildlife and Beatrice dies, Salo decides to continue his mission. Malachi hitches a ride with him to Earth, where he freezes to death at a bus stop outside Indianapolis within hours of his arrival. His last visions are a hallucination planted in his head by Salo, of his friend Stony beckoning him into a spacecraft bound for heaven where he will see Beatrice again.



Questions I still have / want to reflect on:

  * Why did Rumfoord orchestrate this? The Vonnegutian answer is "because he did". Is there a less fatalistic motivation?

  * Also, why did Rumfoord even try to fly out to Mars and end up hitting the "chrono-synclastic infundibula"

  * What is the significance of the scene with Boaz and the alien race on Mercury? Maybe my answer is in a quote by Malachi in the Epilogue:

    > "I miss her [(Beatrice, who had just died)]," [Malachi Constant] said.

    > "You finally fell in love, I see," said Salo [the Tralfamadorian].

    > "Only an Earthling year ago," said Constant. "It took us that long to realize that a purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved."

    Goddamn that makes me want to cry. It also clearly refers to the relationship between Boaz and the harmoniums, who freely give of their love to Boaz and whom Boaz tenderly takes care of. I gave the story of Ruth in the bible a cursory glance, as Boaz is the name of Ruth's husband. Obviously the name choice of Boaz in Sirens bares some connection... but I didn't spend enough time looking at the biblical story to figure it out.

  * Is there some special significance to Salo's message from Tralfamadore? Is the message the medium? Is the medium the message? Is the message the meaninglessness?

  * What's the deal with the fountain on the Rumfoord estate that Malachi climbs near the beginning of the book? It keeps popping up, along with imagery of wet and dry stone.

  * What's the deal with the UWTB? It's clumsily named. It enables in a very roundabout way the creation of Salo's replacement spaceship part, and the collateral action of enlightening the human race... but is that all?

  * Why the hell is the dog named Kazak?

  * Is there philosophical significance to the erasure of brains of the Martian soldiers?

  * Why does Chrono become a Titan-ian bird? For the same reason Boaz became caretaker of the harmoniums?
