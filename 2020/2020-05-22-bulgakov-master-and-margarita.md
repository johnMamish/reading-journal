I got this book from [the David Bowie reading list](https://web.archive.org/web/20160111175933/https://www.davidbowie.com/news/bowie-s-top-100-books-complete-list-52061).

I had a hard time following some parts of this book. I think it might have been the translation, but many of the minor characters in the first half kind of blended together for me into a confusing mess. Nonetheless, I liked it a lot. For some reason the end emotionally affected me a lot.

After spending literally 2 hours writing my stupidly long Gatsby summary, I'm not feeling like writing a summary for this excellent book that I liked a lot. Maybe I'll come back to it later.
