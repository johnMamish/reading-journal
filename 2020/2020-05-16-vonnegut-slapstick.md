This is a real short one. It only took me a few hours to read it.

This might be the most surreal of Vonnegut's books. In the Prologue, Vonnegut says it's an autobiography, and it seems like he's being very.... tongue in cheek.

This isn't a popular opinion (Vonnegut seemed to not like the book much), but I found this book fun to read, in somewhat the same way that Bluebeard was. The story is so bizarre that it's captivating, and in spite of the overall darkness of the book, I found the story to be kind of charming. There are 2 parallel storylines, the post-apocalyptic present (circa 2025 or 2030?) in a Manhattan that's been hollowed out by disease, and the background of


Here are some bizarre plot elements listed. I'm too lazy to describe how these plot elements fit together... and I guess I don't really know how they fit together.
 * Chinese project to build a gigantic telepathic singularity-brain composed of thousands of people
 * Chinese project to shrink people so they will take up less space and be more... elegant?
 * The protagonists can communicate telepathically when they're within a few meters of each other.
 * The fact that the protagonists hid their intellect until the age of 15
 * The synthetic families. Daffodil-11, etc.
 * Why does beoming a slave of Vera Chipmunk-5 Zappa seem so appealing to so many people? Seems like they're not so much slaves as they are members of a peace and love hippie commune.
 * The talking to people in the afterlife.... the "turkey farm".
 * Norman Mushari makes an appearance, Probably AFTER the events of GBYMR. Seems like he's morally straightened up a bit in this book.
 * The gravity gets stronger or weaker on different days, the first time this happens is at the instant that Wilbur gets news of his sister's passing when the gravity becomes crushingly strong.
 * "King of Michigan", "Duke of Oklahoma" emerge after America's collapse.
