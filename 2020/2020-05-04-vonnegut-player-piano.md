not-quite-first-rate dystopian future book with a bitingly sardonic ending.

Paul Proteus is a disquieted engineer living in a society where engineers are king and have automated away all jobs except grueling and almost-useless manual labor and military work (which is useless in a post-scarcity society). Paul is the top of the food chain in his city, making him very rich and for some purposes, a celebrity. Over time and through interactions with 'the commoners' whose jobs have been taken by machine and whose meaning has been stripped from life, Paul slowly comes to believe that his work is destroying society. His demeanor becomes more vacant and he becomes prone to confused and angry outbursts, alienating his wife. Thinking he is still loyal, his employers ask him to 'pretend to be fired' and 'pretend to radicalize' so he can go undercover and infiltrate a radical organization that wishes to destroy modern technology.

Paul does so, with a little less pretending than his employers anticipated. As a fallen chief engineering manager, he becomes the figurehead of the underground organization, which lays waste to the modest metropolis of Ilium, NY, whose engineering and manufacturing operations Paul used to reign over. As Paul and the other leaders of the resistance survey the rubble and try to think of how society can be rebuilt without machines that make people obselete, they see one of their revolutionaries fixing a vending machine that was just destroyed in the name of the cause as a crowd of revolutionaries watches with excitement and awe. Taking this as a symbol that their cause is hopeless, Paul and the other revolution leaders turn themselves into the US government to face legal consequences.


A smaller parallel storyline (which hasn't culturally aged all that well (but not as bad as some things from the 50s)) develops in which a leader of a third world country comes to the states to see the "modern marvels" that we have to author. The visiting leader describes things plainly as he sees them in terms of his own culture, referring to the common people as slaves (because what choice do they have in their lives, really?) and the president as a religious leader.


The themes resonated with me, but this one was a little bit of a slog compared to what I normally expect from Vonnegut.
