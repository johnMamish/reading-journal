Olympic single sculls hopeful, Brad, loses Olympic single scull trials and is forced to try and join the U.S. double or quad scull for the 1984 olympics. His best shot of getting in a boat good enough to win the Olympic double or quad scull trials (held at a later date than the single scull trials) is to head to a competetive camp managed by famed, stoic coach Harry Parker which aims to produce 2 highly competetive boats. A terrible team player, Brad flunks out of the camp and is not offered a spot on either of Harry's 2 boats, which are favorites to win the U.S. pre-Olympic trials and be sent to the olympics. Instead, Harry offers Brad the spot of "alternate double," with the thin ghost of a chance of being promoted to being in the quad (something that's ultimately hopeless, IMO, because Brad hates people).

Instead, Brad strikes out on his own, recruiting acquaintance, Harry Parker rowing camp flunkie, and ex-doubles partner Paul Enquist to train with him for the 4 weeks leading up to the pre-Olympic trials. In solitude, Brad and Paul train hard on their own schedule focusing on fundamentals, racing psychology, and 500m pieces. About a week into their partnership, they join up with a different rowing camp inhabited by 3 scull and sweep quads so that they have people to race against. Brad precieves the coach of this camp to be vastly more personable than Harry and chalks some of his and Paul's success up to the gentleness and non-drama from the new coach (whereas he precieved Harry as a shit-stirrer who caused drama). Brad never seems to tire of bringing down Paul by bringing up to the reader Paul's "humble" beginnings as if Paul is lucky that he's good enough to be rowing with Brad.

At the pre-Olympic trials, Paul and Brad defeat Harry's double scull and are sent to the Olympics, where they win the gold medal. During the medal ceremony, Brad's name is called as Paul's medal is presented to him causing Brad to pitch a tiny fit about it on the Olympic podium: 

>As my name was called over the public address system, he delicately lifted the medal off the tray and began to extend it towards Paul. I put my hand in front of the official, and motioned him towards me.

God, I hate some things about the protagonist of this book. His ego is so delicate that he feels the need to constantly put down those around him. I think that's why he did so poorly at Harry's camp: he couldn't handle the damage to his ego, and the other guys could tell he was a prick, so they didn't want to work well with him. From the way he talks about Paul, I surmise that Brad bullied Paul into being submissive, which suited Brad's ego fine, allowing him to work harder.

The inspiring stuff in the book is the middle third, between chapters 14 and 28, where Paul and Brad begin training hard and steadily together, up until they completely whip the shit out of everyone else at pre-Olympic trials, finishing 6 seconds ahead in 1st on a 2k race. Striking out on their own instead of accepting positions as alternates with Harry's golden boy crew (Paul had gotten an offer to join as an alternate when Brad declined), the underdogs beat the favorites to win by a huge margin due to grit and hard work. It's a shame one of the underdogs is such an ass.
