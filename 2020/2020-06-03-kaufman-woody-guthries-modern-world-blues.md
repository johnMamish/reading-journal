Guthrie was a sophisticated New Yorker who rubbed elbows with many bohemian avant-garde artists, dancers, and writers, all of which informed his work. He inhabited the same spaces that would play host to Warhol and VU 10 years later, and punk music 25 years later. He intentionally played a po-dunk hillbilly character to artistic effect, the same way that David Bowie played the facist Thin White Duke to artistic effect.

Guthrie was acutely aware of modern technological developments and had intense and rapidly shifting feelings about them. TV and film could simultaneously to him be mediums that fonies used to poison people's minds and also be groundbreaking mediums for totally different types of artistic expression.

####Chapter 6 - "Hold the 'fone, it's radio time"

This cornily-titled chapter opens with a few pages about Guthrie's love for the telephone, the goes on to talk about his complicated relationship with radio broadcast.

The way that radio simultaneously connected and alienated rural peoples that Guthrie felt a tie to is discussed through the lens of his novel House of Earth. The rural hillbilly characters in the book are connected to the modern world by a barely-functioning radio, and what they hear makes them feel alienated.

Guthrie's complicated symbiotic relationship with the overzealous American advertising of the 30s-50s is discussed. He was in large part dependant on the advertising for both money AND a channel to broadcast his artwork.
