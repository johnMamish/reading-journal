This is a pretty short book, and I binge read it in one day.

The first 7 chapters were a painful read. The same way that I have trouble watching violent TV shows, I had trouble reading the violent parts of this book. Something that TV shows can't do as easily as this book can is make you relate with the perpetrators of the violence. In this case, the narrator is telling you his story in first person as if he's talking to you. In the first 6 or 7 pages or so, before the violence starts, in spite of myself I found the narrator's patter, slang usage, and familiar way of addressing his readers to be charming. So it was especially horrifying when the narrator started his spree of ultra-violence. Unlike some TV characters, who you might relate with because they're complicated people with complicated motivations, Alex (the narrator) is just an out-and-out vicious psychopath who thinks its great, silly fun to kick people hard in the mouth over and over or rape them.

Short summary:
#### Part 1
Alex is a 15-year old unmitigated psychopath who lives in a dystopian socialist society. He likes listening to classical music and breaking into houses to beat the shit out of people as the de-facto leader of his gang of 4 future-serial-killer friends. One day, Alex and his friends break into a rich old cat lady's house to steal stuff, but she calls the cops right before Alex accidentally kills her, leading to Alex's arrest.

#### Part 2
In prison, Alex ingratiates himself with the prison pastor who lets Alex plan classical music programs for the prison church service; Alex loves reading about the violence in the old testament. Being young, healthy, and psychopathic, 2 years after he arrives at prison Alex is chosen as a candidate for an experimental treatement that will supposedly cure his criminality. The church pastor warns him that the treatment is wicked because it won't teach him to resist wrong, but instead will make him physically incapable of doing wrong things. Alex submits to the treatment anyways; he is carted off to a luxurious facility where he is injected with a chemical that makes him feel extremely ill at the sight of violence and is then forced to watch hours and hours of violent movies and WWII footage while classical music plays in the background. After 2 weeks, he is declared cured and released after a short demonstration for government upper brass where Alex is gently beaten up and insulted by an actor and Alex finds himself unable to hurt the man, instead offering the man cigarettes, his own beloved knife as a present, or to shine the man's shoes.

#### Part 3
Back home, Alex finds that his parents, thinking he would be in jail for at least 20 years, have taken a boarder up in his old room and that all of his possessions have been seized and sold by the government for funds to fulfill the will of the old lady he killed. He finds that his favorite record shop has changed owners, and worst of all finds that he can't listen to classical music without becoming violently ill. Homeless and without passion in life, Alex resolves to kill himself. He goes to a library to read about suicide methods, but is beaten up there by an old man who he had severely maimed before he was sent to prison. As a result of the commotion, the cops are called, and Alex is presumed to be the offender. He is driven off the the countryside and beaten severely by two police officers, one of whom is an ex-member of Alex's old gang.

Alex seeks refuge in a house he and his friends ransacked years ago, raping and killing the woman who lived there and severely beating her husband. The owner doesn't recognize Alex as his wife's rapist and killer, but does recognize him from newspapers, as Alex's treatment and rehabilitation are hot news items. The homeowner is excessively nice to Alex and lets him stay the night. Alex slowly finds out that the homeowner is an anti-establishment political activist whose colleagues want to use Alex's plight as a government guinea pig to curry dilike towards the current government among the populace. Alex is put up in a nice hotel and - spurned by loud classical music playing in the room next door and by pamphlets left on the table - attempts suicide by jumping out the window; Alex suspects that the music and pamphletswere planted by the political group that put him up in the hotel so that he'd kill himself and become their martyr.

Alex barely survives the suicide attempt and recovers in a hospital. There, he is treated with other drugs that reverse the effects of "Ludovico's method", and his ability to relish in violence and classical music return. He's promised freedom and a cushy job at the government.

#### Part 3, chapter 7
This chapter was not included in the American edition of the book; Burgess may have added it at the urging of British publishers asking for a happier ending.

1 year after Alex's release, he has a new gang of goons. They engage in similar acts of violence, but Alex doesn't usually partake, he just watches, usually unexcitedly. One night he abandons his gang early, not wanting to take part in that night's violence, instead opting to drink tea by himself in a cafe. There, he runs into a Pete who used to be in his gang. Pete is 20 and is happily married. Alex ends the novel by saying his days of violence are probably behind him, and now he wants to focus on finding a wife and starting a family.


### Things I liked about the book
  - I tend to hate made-up words in sci-fi books, but I loved the slang in this book. I thought it was sloppily executed from time to time (the author tends to have a 1-to-1 correlation between slang words and parts of speech, and the development of slang is often more nuanced and complicated than just a find-and-replace; Burgess also rarely reuses existing words for slang terms, which is an extraordinaily common real life occurance ('that's cool', 'this song slaps', 'I'm so hype'), but overall enjoyed it a lot. I've got to give praise to some of the words Burgess came up with ('horrorshow', 'skorry', 'viddy' (but maybe 'viddy' would be better as 'give it a vid')
  - One of the central ideas - whether acting moral is any good if someone doesn't have a choice - is an interesting rumination on free will and intention vs action. It has some delicious overlap with the protagonist of Vonnegut's Mother Night.
  - The finding that Alex's love of classical music was accidentally crushed by the same 'Ludovico's technique' that soured him on 'the old twenty-to-one' is a worthwhile meditation on 'throwing out the baby with the bathwater'.
  - One of Alex's old droogies, Dim, becoming a cop is a nice criticism of police brutality.

Things I didn't like about this book
  - Precieved a strong stripe of Ayn Rand running through it.
  - I don't know if communism is the answer, but some parts of the book felt like a bad-faith strawman against it. Did you really need to make the language of the hyper-violent thuggish youth come from "slav. propaganda"?

    >‘These grahzny sodding veshches that come out of my gulliver and my plott,’ I said, ‘that’s what it is.’

    >‘Quaint,’ said Dr Brodsky, like smiling, ‘the dialect of the tribe. Do you know anything of its provenance, Branom?’

    > ‘Odd bits of old rhyming slang,’ said Dr Branom, who did not look quite so much like a friend any more. ‘A bit of gipsy talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav. Propaganda. Subliminal penetration.’

    > A Clockwork Orange, Book 2, Chapter 6

  - A central argument of the book seems to be that teens are unrepressably violent, and then these urges fade once they hit 19 or 20. My evidence?
      - The book's epigraph is a Shakespeare quote saying that kids are useless rakes between the ages of 10 and 23.

      >SHEPHERD: I would that there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fightin

      You know what? fuck you!

      - The "optional chapter" 21 describes Alex as starting to soften up once he hits the ripe old age of 19
        Really??? fuck you!!

      - The "optional chapter" 21 shows that Alex's old vicious droogie Pete has gotten married and is on the fast track to being a respectable member of society.
        Really??? fuck you!!

     I don't really know what Burgess's political leanings are, but this critical element of the book seems to suggest a callousness and fundamental misunderstanding towards youth that I associate with fascists and authoritarians. Alex is written as a violent psychopath; that sort of thing doesn't just evaporoate when puberty starts to taper off. It's not like Alex was an impressionable and confused 15 year old who tagged along with future serial killer chums, it's told in the first person so we know that Alex had an overwhelming passion for beating the shit out of innocent people. Moreover, it seems like this sort of way of thinking and acting has become endemic among the youths of Burgess's socialist dystopia.

     Take this quote from the very end of Book 3, Chapter 7:

     > But then I knew he [(the narrator's future son)] would not understand or would not want to understand at all and would do all the veshches I had done, yes perhaps even killing some poor starry forella surrounded with mewing kots and koshkas, and I would not be able to really stop him. And nor would he be able to stop his own son, brothers.

     NO! THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS! What sort of child were you, what sort of psychopath are you, Anthony Burgess, if you think that this sort of thinking could become an epidemic among kids?
