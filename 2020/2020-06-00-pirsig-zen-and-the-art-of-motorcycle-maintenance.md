I read this while visiting Oliver in LA. It seems like the book has a central point it's trying to make, but there are a lot of beautiful little vignettes that don't seem to contribute directly to its main or supporting points. There are also a lot of vignettes that seem to be more or less masked analogies about central points that the book is trying to make.

##### Chapter 1
This chapter mostly sets up the framing that contains the rest of the story. The narrator (who's unnamed?) is taking a cross-country motorcycle road trip with his 11-year old son Chris (riding on the same bike as him) and the narrator's friends, John and Sylvia. The narrator frames the rest of the book as a "Chautauqua" (Chautauquas are named for Chautauqua, New York and were a strain of philosophical lecture series popular in the USA around the 1870s - 1930s; according to the narrator, they were educational, entertaining, and throught-provoking) inspired by "an undercurrent of disharmony" between Sylvia and John which may appear surface level but may have its genesis in deep philosophical differences. The narrator first became aware of this disharmony because of repeated arguments between himself and John about John's refusal to learn about motorcycle maintenance. After a lot of thinking, the author finds that John's reluctance is rooted in something deep within him, and cannot be changed by argumentation or discussion about the surface issue.

> So it is with John. I could preach the practical value and worth of motorcycle maintenance til I'm hoarse and it would not make a dent in him.
  - Pirsig, page 19

I believe that this hints at a deep theme that comes later in the book, and a theme that comes up in psychotherapy and I imagine comes up in philosophy: that sometimes surface level opinions or observations are the consequence of a byzantine and deeply rooted palace of thought inside our psyches, like the other 90% of an iceburg.

##### Chapter 2
The bike group is beginning to run into a bad storm.

The narrator expounds on the virtues of learning about motorcycle maintenance by recounting a couple of incidents about 3 years before the narrative present.

In the first, the narrator and his son are on a road trip, and they hit very severe rain. During the rainstorm, their motorcycle starts to intermittently misfire and slow down. The narrator pulls off into a gas station and inspects every part of the bike before brokenheartedly telling his son that their road trip is over. They trailer the bike back, and a couple weeks later, as the narrator is taking apart the bike to inspect it more fully and repair it, he finds that the gas tank was just empty.

In the second, the narrator talks about how he let his motorcycle engine overheat, which caused a piston to seize. He took the motorcycle to a group of mechanics, who carelessly diagnosed the issue incorrectly and as a result damaged the bike, overcharging him to boot. The narrator ends the anecdote by discussing the difference between interacting with the world as a spectator and actually living in the world.

> The mechanics in their attitude toward the machine were really taking no different attitude from the manual's toward the machine, or from the attitude I had when I brought it in there [as opposed to fixing it myself].
