A young freelance journalist finds himself by happenstance and curiosity sucked into the world of competitive memorizing. He plots his journey over the course of a year as he goes from bemused spectator to American memory champion by training modestly and soliciting the help of a European memory champ and a cognitive sciences professor.

As Foer traces his journey, he makes gratituitous stops to discuss how memory was important in our past (oral tradition), and how memorization aids (books, computers, lifelogging) have shaped and distorted the way we preceive culture, time, and reality. He also examines cognition and memory through the lens of unusual cases almost a la Oliver Sacks, but maybe a little more pseudoscientific (not to say that Foer's writing veers so far into pseudoscience as to be discreditable). He labors to make connections between memory and expertise; he has tons of compelling anecdotal evidence (SWAT officers spotting a concealed bomb (are they experts or just trigger happy), chicken sexing (ugh)). The most compelling thing he talks about is how expert chess players see the board differently, but it's still anecdotal.

The book is pockmarked by social immaturity on the part of Foer and his friends. The social immaturity often comes through in the social scenes Foer describes at bars, parties, and memory championships (some of these people could take fashion advice from a 12-year-old boy in a minecraft tshirt), but sometimes the social immaturity leaks out in the writing, like when Foer awkwardly stretches himself out to attack "savant" Daniel Tammett with prose or when he somewhat coldly and unsympathetically (to my reading) treats severe amnesia sufferer 'EP'.


These things about the book are valuable

  * The pop-history retrospective on memory throughout human history IMO provides valuable perspective on where we are today
  * The story provides a powerful anecdotal illustration about how "deliberate practice" can pay off quickly, when applied carefully
  * The story itself is pretty entertaining, watching a novice immerse himself in a bizarre sport; but the story itself is not much more than entertainment in my opinion.


After reading it I spent about 30 minutes inventing and practicing a one-digit PAO mnemonic. To my huge surprise, I could memorize about 40 digits in 5 minutes using my 2018/2019 Ann Arbor apartment as a memory palace.
