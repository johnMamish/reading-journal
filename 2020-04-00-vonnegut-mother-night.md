Vonnegut is so damn good.

I don't know why this book is called 'Mother Night'.

I should go back and write more about this, but it seems to be a mediatation on whether people are what they seem to be, and whether people are more than their actions, and what weights intent, net effect, and public perception have in determining someone's wickedness.

The protagonist was an American spy and Nazi propagandist who shouted scathing racist diatribes over Nazi radio for nearly 5 years, with critically important American intelligence messages knowingly coded into his frothy-mouthed nationalistic warbling. Because his information was criticlally impartaont to the war, he did net good, but his actions felt bad to him and appeared bad to everyone except for himself, a couple of spies, and the president of the U.S..


>"I found out she was missing the same day you did." he [Howard Campbell (the protagonist)'s handler, Wirtanen]  said.\
>"You knew about [my wife's disappearance]?" I said.\
>"I found out she was missing the same day you did," he said.\
>"How?" I said.\
>"From you," he said. "that was one of the pieces of information you broadcast that night." ...\
>... One part of me told the world of the tragedy in code. The rest of me did not even know that the announcement was being made.
