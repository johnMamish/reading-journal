In this partial autobiography Patti Smith, well-known for her visual art, poetry, and most of all her literary music that lies at the odd intersection of folk, punk, new-wave, and beat poetry, tells of her life in New York City during her 20's through the lens of her at-first romantic relationship with artist Robert Mapplethorpe.

Save for the twist that comes less than halfway through the book - in which Robert wrestles with the realization that he might be gay, transforming his love for Patti from a romantic fire to a glowingly warm sibling-like love - the bones of the story are pretty simple; we follow Robert and Patti as they start out as homeless drifters in NYC and gradually, by relentlessly consuming, collaborating upon, and creating art, climb to the upper echelons of the NYC social ladder. The simplicity of the story doesn't stop it from being beautiful, inspiring, and heart-warming. A massive amount of beauty lies in the vignettes that Patti illustrates of their artsy, bohemian, NYC existance. The book is gut-wrenching because of the simple but intense (and always affectionate) emotional roller of Patti and Robert's relationship as Robert struggles and ultimately comes to peace with his sexual orientation.

Over the course of the book Patti struggles as a visual artist, and in the last 70 or so pages, influenced by encounters with famous NYC musicians and poets, does an about-face and at Robert's urging focuses on spoken-word poetry which eventually evolves into rock music. In the early pages of the book, the weeks creep by slowly, but as Patti achieves fame and prepares to leave NYC, the storytelling accelerates drastically. A short coda to the book describes Robert's diagnosis with AIDS and ultimate death about 15 years after the events of the book. By this time, Patti has long moved out of NYC and is married with kids. She falls out of touch with Robert for a time, but the two become close again after his AIDS diagnosis; she begins to regularly visit him in NYC.

> We were walking toward the fountain, the epicenter of activity, when an older couple stoppped and openly observed us [dressed in beatnik sandals, ragged scarves, and love beads]. Robert enjoyed being noticed, and he affectionately squeezed my hand.
> "Oh, take their picture," said the woman to her bemused husband, "I think they're artists."
> "Oh, go on," he shrugged. "They're just kids."
