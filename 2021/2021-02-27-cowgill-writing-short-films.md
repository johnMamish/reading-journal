This book was lent to by by Xavier Villar-Brasser's friend, Daniel (he's the singer for Xavier's band (that I play drums for right now) - "the altars" - and is a film student at NU).

#### Chapter 1 - "Before We Start - the Principles of Drama"
Humans have told stories since time immemorial; they're an important vehicle through which we contextualize and understand our world and our experiences. Althought the drama underpinning a story typically involves 2 key elements - a character who takes action to achieve something and the confrontation of conflict by this character - a story is more than just "assembling a string of incidents". Desire and conflict need to push and pull characters, and the mechanism by which this push and pull is illustrated depends on the medium used (film, audio, book, etc). The author illustrates this point by presenting some very dry lines of dialog (page 6). Once a backstory for the dialog is supplied giving the characters desire and conflict, the dialog is much less dry and more meaningful. Typically speaking, the desire and conflict should be communicated not by dialog, but by action: show what's happening and let the viewer follow.

The medium through which the story is told affects things a lot. Shorter pieces give the creator much more leeway to have unlikeable characters or to deeply explore mundane scenarios.
